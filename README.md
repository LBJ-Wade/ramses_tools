RAMSES tools
------------

Two simple tools for helping to manage RAMSES runs

* `how_much_cpu.py` generates brief reports (and a PDF plot, if matplotlib is installed) to monitor the CPU usage of a run
* `update_nml.py` updates the `.nml` file for your run to make it restart at the latest available output
